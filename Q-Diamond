We, at ‘Q-Diamond’, recognise Quantum Technology as cutting edge field in current era. Considering its importance, we designed an interactive introductory module  to introduce high school students, particularly from Computer Science and Physics backgroud to the basics concepts of the field . After completion of the module, students will be able to understand the idea of Entanglement, Superposition, Cold atoms, Integration methods for  on-chip quantum photonics and the behaviour of light-matter interaction in optical and atomic systems and their applications in Quantum hardware to be used in Quantum Information.

We hope that Q-Diamond will step-up the knowledge of targeted students and will be of long term benefits to them. Thank you again for joining us and we look forward to see you strive in this journey.
