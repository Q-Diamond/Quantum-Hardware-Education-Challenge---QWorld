# Quantum-Hardware-Education-Challenge---QWorld
Womanium Quantum Hackathon 2022

We, at ‘Q-Diamond’, recognize Quantum Technology as a cutting-edge field in the current era. Considering its importance, we designed an interactive introductory module to introduce high school students, particularly from Computer Science and Physics backgrounds to the basic concepts of the field. After completing the module, students will be able to understand the idea of Entanglement, Superposition, Cold atoms, Integration methods for on-chip quantum photonics, and the behavior of light-matter interaction in optical and atomic systems and their applications in Quantum hardware to be used in Quantum Information.

We hope that Q-Diamond will step up the knowledge of targeted students and will be of long-term benefit to them. Thank you again for joining us and we look forward to seeing you strive on this journey.
